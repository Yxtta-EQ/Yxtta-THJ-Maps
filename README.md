# Yxtta-THJ-Maps
Map Packs for THJ

Included is my modified Brewall Map Pack for THJ. 
I will be updating the file as expansions are unlocked.
Mostly to include Waypoint and Echo location labels.
As time goes on will likely update and fix spawn points that are different here from live. 
If you have anything you would like to see added or if you have any suggestions on things that should be changed please dm me on discord at username: vespulax

Here in this read me I will include a written list of zones that include a waypoint for easy of nagivation to the zone then in the zone map you can find the waypoint label.
